# Supplementary-data-of-MATLAB-and-FLAC-codes
A binary classification method for efficient and accurate system reliability analyses of layered slopes (Cases code files)
1.The version of FLAC is 7.0.
2.Put all files and folders (e.g., within Case1) into the same same folder together with FLAC executable program, Then, run the FLAC console program, and type the following cammand "call FlacMainFile.txt". Now, the FLAC is in a loop state and waiting for calculating request from MATLAB
3.Run the file "mainfile.m" with MATLAB
